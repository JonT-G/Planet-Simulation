A simulation of some planets oribiting the sun using real distances and physics. You can add or delete planets, just use the correct distance from sun in AU. 
There is also some feature like pause, by pressing "ESC" the simulation pauses and some info is displayed, how far each planet currenctly is from the sun. 
You can move the screen by left mouse click and holding to move around, release to stop movement.
It was added as the futher planets like venus, neptun, and saturn would be outside the window.
There is also a zoom function, in and out. If too low change the "zoom_increment" variable.
